You are given a nxn ( take n as input) grid and a set of k (take value of k as input)  grid position B = {(x1, y1), (x2,y2) ,....., (xk,yk)} marked as blocked / unusuable ( generate these positions randomly). You are given as input source s=(xs,ys) and destination d=(xd,yd). Find and enumerate the path from s to d, avoiding the blocked grid position if there exists any path. 

> Note: You move only in horizontal or vertical direction in the grid, not diagonal.
