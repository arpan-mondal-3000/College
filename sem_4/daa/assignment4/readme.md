### Assignment 4 : Implement shortest path  Algorithms 

_Date: May 8, 2026_

1. Generate a directed weighted graph randomly of n vertices and m edges (Take n and m from user) and choose a source at random.
2. Check if there is any negative weight cycle in it using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
3. If there is no negative weight cycle, give the input to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
4. Print the shortest path from s to all other vertices  along with length of shortest path for both algorithms.
