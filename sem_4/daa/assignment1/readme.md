1. Create a file containing an adjacency matrix representing an undirected unweighted graph G. [Take input from user, the number of vertices n and number of edges m. Generate the edges of the graph randomly]

2. Take input s, the starting vertices. Find the shortest path from s to all other vertices enumering each of them with length of the shortest path.

3. Give a visualization of the graph using some tool.
