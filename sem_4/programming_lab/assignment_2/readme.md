Let us create Student Database in C. The database consists of 2 Tables namely StudentTb and MarksTb. Each table is implemented as binary files. Each record of **StudentTb** contains **<RollNo, Name>** whereas each record of **MarksTb** contains **<RollNo, Marks>**.

Write a menu driven program to perform various operations on Student Database with the following menus:

1. Insert a record in StudentTb
2. Insert a record in MarksTb
3. Search Student Name by RollNo
4. Search Marks by RollNo
5. Display StudentTb
6. Display MarksTb
7. Display Student Details (RollNo Name Marks)
8. Display Full Result (RollNo Name Marks)

For each of the menus take appropriate inputs from the Keyboard.
