(Refer to the Slides for algorithm )

**Input:** The number of elements to be sorted n
**Output:** See Notes

**Note:**

1. You should generate n random numbers using your own program as a function.

2. Run your program for n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 20000, 40000, 50000

3. Write a function to verify if numbers are indeed sorted.

4. For each run, count the number of comparisons. Make a table in doc /xls file with columns, n and number of comparisons in each case. Plot a graph of n vs # of comparisons.
