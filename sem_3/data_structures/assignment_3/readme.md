_**Date:** 4 Sept, 2024_

Write a C program to implement two long intergers of m and n digits.

**Input:**
Enter length of first number: 20
Enter first number of length 20: 12345678909876543210
Enter length of second number: 12
Enter second number of length 12: 100000000000

**Output:** 12345678909876543210 x 100000000000 = 1234567890987654321000000000000

> Give the time complexity of your algorithm.
> ans: O(n^2)

> **Note:** You need to use array of characters ( dynamically allocate 1D array) to store large integers and their product.
