## Statement

## Implement Hashing using following collision resolution technique

1. Chaining
2. Linear Probing
3. Quadratic Probing
4. Double Hashing

Take 50000 random numbers as keys. Insert them in the hash table in same order for all the four cases above.

1. For chaining, report minimum, maximum and average length of chain
2. For linear, quadratic probing and double hashing, report average number of probes required in each case.
