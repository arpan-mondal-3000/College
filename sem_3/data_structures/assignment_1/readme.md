### Statement

_**Date:** 20 Aug, 2024_

Write a c code for the following:
**Input:** a set of n numbers in an array A
**Output:** If there exist a majority element, print it else print no majority element.

> What is a Majority element? Majority element is one which occurs more than half of the total number of elements in the array, ie, if there are n elements, then more than floor (n/2) times.

**Example 1:** Input: A = [ 2, 1, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6]. then n = 8.
Majority element is one which occurs more than floor (8/2) = 4 times in A.
Output: 2, since it occurs 5 times (5>4) in A.

**Example 2:** Input: A = [ 2, 1, 2, 2, 6, 1, 7, 6]. then n = 8.
Majority element is one which occurs more than floor (8/2) = 4 times in A.
Output: No majority element, Since none of 1,2,6,7 in A occurs more than 4 times in A.

Upload the a) program (.c file) in classroom along with a b) documentation (.docx) that contains the following:

1. Input, Output clearly defined
2. Algorithm as statements or Pseudocode or flowchart (not the program)
3. A dry run of your algorithm
