## Statement:

_Date: 11th Nov, 2024_
**Write a menu driven ( see below) program to implement addition, subtraction, multiplications of two polynomial expression that uses circular singly linked list. The node stores the coefficient, exponent pair of the polynomial expression. they must always be in decreasing order of the exponent in the circular singly linked list. Use avail list of free nodes to get and return nodes to or from the avail list whenever required.**

The menu is as follows:

1. Create a polynomial
2. Add polynomial (A, B)
3. Subtract polynomial (A, B)
4. Multiply polynomial (A, B)
5. Display polynomial (A)
6. Erase a polynomial (A)
7. Exit
