### Statement

**Write a program to create a Binary search tree. You must have the following functions:**

- Insert(x)
- Search(x)
- DisplayBST(): by in order traversal
- Delete (x)
- Height(x) : find height of the node that has key x

Take inputs randomly to insert in the BST.

Run you code for n =500, 1000, 5000, 20000, 50000, keys Compute # of comparisons in each case and plot as a graph n vs. number of comparisons.
